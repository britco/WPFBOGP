Welcome to the GitHub repository
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin adds well executed and accurate Facebook Open Graph Meta tag information to your site. The idea is to keep minimal settings and options as to remain out of your way and in the background while still proving a powerful Open Graph plugin for your WordPress site. This plugin works on Facebook, Google Plus, Linkedin, and any site that reads open graph tags.

*Shortname: WPFBOGP*
